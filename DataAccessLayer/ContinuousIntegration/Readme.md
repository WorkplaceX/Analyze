#Generate C# Code
Class GenerateCSharp queries database schema and generates file Database.cs with C# code in it. With this approach the generation of C# code can be controlled precisely. Further for every field a C# class is generated. And for every database schema a unique C# namespace is generated.

#Output
File WebApplication\Database.cs is generated.
